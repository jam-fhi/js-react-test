## Project Quick Start

After installing the requirements above, in the project directory run `yarn && yarn start`. This will:

 - Install node dependancies for the client and the server
 - Download and start docker container for MySQL (accessible on `localhost:3306` - details in `server/package.json`)
 - Run PM2 in watch mode to start and live-refresh an express server (accessable at `http://localhost:8080/`)
 - Start and live-refresh a react app on the client (accessable at `http://localhost:3000/`)

The client and server will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
